# WhatsApp Bot Image Setup Guide

## 🚨 Current Issue
The WhatsApp bot cannot display car images because they are not publicly accessible from the internet.

## 🔧 Solutions

### Option 1: Use NGROK (Recommended for Development)
1. Install NGROK: https://ngrok.com/
2. Run: `ngrok http 3000`
3. Copy the public URL (e.g., `https://abc123.ngrok.io`)
4. Set environment variable:
   ```bash
   NGROK_URL=https://abc123.ngrok.io
   ```

### Option 2: Use a Public Hosting Service
1. Upload images to a public service (AWS S3, Cloudinary, etc.)
2. Set environment variable:
   ```bash
   PUBLIC_URL=https://your-domain.com
   ```

### Option 3: Deploy to Production
1. Deploy your app to a public server (Heroku, Vercel, etc.)
2. Images will be automatically accessible

## 📝 Current Behavior
- ✅ Car details are displayed correctly
- ✅ All functionality works (browse, filter, test drive booking)
- ❌ Images are not shown (fallback to text-only)
- ✅ User experience is maintained with informative messages

## 🎯 Impact
- **Low Impact**: Core functionality works perfectly
- **Images**: Only visible when publicly accessible URLs are configured
- **User Experience**: Maintained with clear messaging about image availability

## 🚀 Quick Fix
Add this to your `.env` file:
```bash
NGROK_URL=https://your-ngrok-url.ngrok.io
# OR
PUBLIC_URL=https://your-public-domain.com
```

## 📱 WhatsApp Requirements
- Images must be publicly accessible from the internet
- URLs must use HTTPS (except for localhost during development)
- Images must be under 5MB
- Supported formats: JPG, JPEG, PNG
